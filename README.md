# Calculator
I created a simple desktop application using Java that serves as a calculator. 
This application allows users to perform basic mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
With its clean and user-friendly interface, the calculator provides a convenient tool for quick and accurate computations.
